# Clothesy

Clothesy is a project that involves creating the front-end for a clothes online shopping store with the use of an external API. It was created by a group of three through agile development and with the use of react and redux for saving state to a common and easily accessible store. I was personally responsible for the reviews section/widget.

First install dependencies with npm install. Then use npm run build-prod to create the production build bundle.js for the react application. Then use npm start and application can be accessed on localhost:3000.
